[Simple Vanilla Javascript Project Ideas](https://www.vanillajavascriptprojects.com/)

This will be a series of challenges split into DOM projects, and more exclusive projects. I will be attempting to recreate most of these.

Seems like this will be a good practice of recreating some simple css styling, and interacting with the DOM which I don't have a lot of practice in.

I will be doing all of these with React using a Vite setup for each project. Something to look into in the future would be how to do this in a monorepo, as that seems like it would cut down on the overhead of setting up a new package.json to install the same packages for each tiny project.

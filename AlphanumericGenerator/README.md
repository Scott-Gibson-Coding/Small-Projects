# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

# Added Tailwind

Tailwind should be set up with this project already, simply
add tailwind css class names to the html to get started.

### Final thoughts on project

- Project could have used better documentation and commenting.
- There are several places where code is repeated, could move their logic into small
  components and hooks.
- Using some state management would remove the need for callback function calls.
- A good improvement would be to add tooltips giving the user more specific information
  when hovering over numerical or checkbox inputs.
